          I don't read blogs and I certainly do NOT write so if this is fucked up then cry about it. <br>
          Making this website was extremely easy especially considering it is only css and html, however it was pretty fucking obnoxious.<br>
          So to begin, css is literally all testing. If it doesn't look good, change your code, save it, and refresh the page being hosted.<br>
          I haven't fucked with html and css since high school so it looks pretty awful rn but it works. Alot will be added as time progresses and Eventually I will be learning php and next.js for future endeavours.<br>
          This website will essentially act as my portfolio and I will also be displaying some cool things in the future (stay tuned)<br>
          I have been fucking around with this fucking abomination all day, mainly unable to decide on a look and layout until I settled on this one and said fuck it.<br>
          This post will be extremely short this time around but in the future I will put more effort into these (I promise you fucking cutie).<br>
          If you want me to post about a specific topic just hmu in either bacalhau's discord server or dm me. My discord tag is on the home page<br>
          Toodles!
